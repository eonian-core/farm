    ## Eonian is a Decentralized <br /> Yield Aggregator

    The protocol generates [real yield](/faq#what-is-real-yield) rewards by distributing liquidity 
    to the most profitable and secure projects on the blockchain. 
    It uses multiple smart contracts to collect and reinvest rewards in a way that maximizes your profit 
    and decrease the time you spend on investments.

    ## Stable and High Yield

    Our focus is on not only achieving high returns but also ensuring
    stability in our work and investment strategies. While a high [APY](/faq#what-is-apy) may be
    attractive, it is important to consider the sustainability and
    consistency of the results.

    * ### Stable Rewards
        We diversify the investments across multiple protocols and continuously
        monitor their rewards to ensure stability in your profits.
    * ### High Rewards
        We continuously enhance our investment strategies with the knowledge of
        crypto experts to generate the highest possible rewards in DeFi space.
    * ### Lower Fees
        We minimize fees for our clients by combining transactions from multiple
        users and reducing interactions with other protocols.
    * ### Effective Strategies
        Prior to investment, we thoroughly evaluate protocols to identify any
        hidden fees and optimize our strategies to minimize them.
    * ### Real Yield
        We provide rewards exclusively in the form of the tokens in which you
        have invested. To mitigate the effects of inflation, we sell tokens
        issued by the underlying protocols.
    * ### Real APY
        Other protocols may show you big numbers to entice you to invest, while
        we provide a realistic estimate of the returns you can expect.

    ## Safe Investments

    We bring our expertise in enterprise-grade software development to the cryptocurrency industry.
    Utilizing proven [SecOps](/faq#what-is-secops) and [SSDLC](/faq#what-is-ssdlc) monitoring and testing methods,
    we strive to deliver the safest solution possible.

    * ### Hacks Protection
        We constantly monitor DeFi-related hacks in other protocols and
        develop defense mechanisms to keep our contracts safe from potential threats.
    * ### Fraud Monitoring
        We continuously monitor the transactions of investment protocols and
        take action to ensure the security of our clients' investments by promptly
        withdrawing funds in case of any suspicious activity.
    * ### Independent Audits
        We conduct independent 95-point audits of investment protocols to thoroughly
        evaluate their security and ensure that we only select the safest options for our clients.
    * ### Vertical Safety Integration
        We collaborate with the teams of investment protocols to proactively identify and address
        vulnerabilities to prevent potential abuse.
    * ### Permissionless Protocol
        Our protocol is decentralized and operates on a permissionless model.
        Our smart contracts are designed to ensure that only you have access to your tokens.

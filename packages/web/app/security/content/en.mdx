    # We are Proud of Our Security

    We take a security-first approach to ensure that
    all of our contracts are safe to use. We use
    enterprise-level software security practices such as
    SecOps and Secure SDLC, which have already shown
    great results in the Web2 world, but have been
    overlooked by many Web3 developers.

    ## SecOps

    <SecOpsDescription>
        We don't stop at the audit of the protocol. Security is
        not a point where you can stop working. We
        monitor new breaches and hacks in DeFi to quickly
        react and fix vulnerabilities where others may be failing. We
        are creating new practices that can be implemented
        only in DeFi.

        ### Risk & Threat model

        We designed the protocol while keeping in mind many
        known vulnerabilities of popular smart contracts

                ### Code Review

                Each line of code was reviewed multiple times for high-level
                logic issues, security vulnerabilities, and gas
                usage inefficiencies.

                ### Code coverage
                > 100%

                All smart contracts are fully covered with functional and security tests.

                ### Code issues
                > Zero

                We use static code analysis to continuously validate all contracts and resolve all code issues.

                    **Green**
                </SecOpsStatusIndicator>

                Our monitoring system shows the current liquidity management status,
                so you always know that you are depositing money into a correctly working protocol without any hacks.

    ## Deep Security

    <DeepSecurityDescription>
        We want to set new security standards for DeFi, that other protocols will follow. We want
        to improve security not only for ourselves but for all protocols in which we invest!

            ### Investment protocols

            We add new investment strategies with new protocols only after a deep independent audit from our team.

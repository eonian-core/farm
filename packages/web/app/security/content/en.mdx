    <ApproachDescription>
        We take security first approach to make sure
        all our contracts are safe to use. We use
        enterprise level software security practices:
        SecOps and Secure SDLC, which already showed
        great results in Web2 world, but was
        forgotten by Web3 developers.

        We donâ€™t stop at audit of protocol. Security is
        not a point, where you can stop working. We
        monitor new breaches and hacks in DeFi to quickly
        react and fix places where other failing. We
        creating new practices, which can be implemented
        only in DeFi.

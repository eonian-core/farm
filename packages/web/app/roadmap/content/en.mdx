    # Roadmap

    
    Eonian is dedicated to reshaping the DeFi sector by developing a comprehensive ecosystem that includes 
    a secure yield aggregator, a decentralized insurance protocol, and an advanced Smart Contract Wallet. 
    
    These offerings aim to eliminate existing problems and risks in the decentralized financial world, 
    ensuring safety and ease of use for all users. To achieve a balance between our long-term vision 
    and immediate problem-solving, we're developing a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). 
    
    This DAO will allow community members to propose and vote on changes to our roadmap while receiving 
    dividends as a share of the protocol's revenue. The roadmap on this page provides a detailed look 
    at our past achievements as well as our future plans, all designed to fulfill our goal of making DeFi 
    safer and more efficient.

            ### Audit of ApeSwap Protocol

            <RoadmapDate>August, 2022</RoadmapDate>

            We made an independent and comprehensive protocol audit, focusing not only on the code
            but also on the economic and governance model.

            ### Completed Yield Farming Strategies Research

            <RoadmapDate>November, 2022</RoadmapDate>

            We researched promising passive investment strategies for future automation in our protocol and published a guide for investors.
            We found all involved risks and ways to overcome them, as and expected profits from the strategy.

            ### Completed Impermanent Loss Research

            <RoadmapDate>March, 2023</RoadmapDate>

            We researched the problem of Impermanent Losses
            to find proper ways to estimate expected profits in different DEXes and mitigate the risks.
            We published a summary of one of the detailed research about impermanent losses,
            along with our guides on how to overcome different types of losses in DEXes.

            <RoadmapDate>March, 2023</RoadmapDate>

            We have completed our research on yield opportunities with liquid staking derivatives in the DeFi space
            to implement a farming strategy based on them in the future.
            As a result, we have published an article that provides a brief explanation of how LSD tokens work
            and the strategies that currently exist.

            ### Eonian Protocol Alpha Test Launched
            
            <RoadmapDate>July 3, 2023</RoadmapDate>

            We have released the alpha version of our protocol.
            We started with an automated investment strategy for a single stablecoin.
            Then, as we prioritize careful development, we will gradually introduce advanced strategies to boost APY.
            During the closed alpha test, we aim to identify critical bugs and potential issues in our protocol.
            We will offer exclusive benefits to reward alpha testers for their help!

            ### Eonian Protocol Closed Beta Test

            <RoadmapDate>Q4 2023</RoadmapDate>

            After the alpha test, we expect to have a much more stable and higher APY.
            During the beta test, we'll focus on enhancing the safety of our protocol.
            Beta testers will receive similar perks to alpha testers but with lower 
            token rates, and we're capping the number of participants at 200.

            and developing major security solutions. 
            There will be no limits for deposits and the number of users!

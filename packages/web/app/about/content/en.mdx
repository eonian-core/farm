# We Are Eonian

The Eonian primary purpose is to make crypto a simpler and safer replacement for the traditional financial system. 
That's why we decided to start from investments.

Decentralized on a blockchain version of a traditional investment fund is commonly called a crypto yield aggregator. 
The exact such solution we are creating while focusing on uncommon features for them: safety and stability. 


The Problem

## Crypto Promised <br/> The New Financial System

While many claim that crypto will revolutionize the financial system,
in reality, people who believe in the promise have been burned by scams and fraud.

Don't let this happen to you.


The Solution

## Investments without Risk

Crypto has the potential to become the new financial system, but it must be both profitable and safe. 
That's why we decided to build a decentralized crypto yield aggregator which prioritizes security.

We bring our experience and thoroughness in creating enterprise-grade software to the crypto world. 
We use proven [SecOps](https://www.servicenow.com/products/security-operations/what-is-secops.html) and [SSDLC](https://snyk.io/learn/secure-sdlc/) monitoring and testing methods to develop the safest solution. 

And we do not stop there. 
We are creating new practices that are only possible in DeFi, 
such as [95-point independent auditing](https://leovs09.notion.site/Crypto-Project-Audit-Checklist-e24414dcd1c94b5f818343d46f25013d) of all third-party protocols in which our solution will invest tokens.

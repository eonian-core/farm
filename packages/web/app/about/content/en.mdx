# We Are <br /> Eonian

Our team is a group of experienced software engineers and product developers inspired by the idea of a decentralized financial system.
A system where banks are primarily focused on maximizing people's funds and are owned collectively by their clients.

However, upon exploring the DeFi space, we discovered that the crypto world is still a far cry from realizing this vision. 
To address this issue, we started with a problem...

    ## Crypto Promised <br/> The New Financial System

    While many claim that crypto will revolutionize the financial system,
    in reality, people who believe in the promise have been burned by scams and fraud.

    Don't let this happen to you.

    ## Investments without Risk

    Crypto has the potential to become the new financial system, but it must be both profitable and safe. 
    That's why we decided to build a crypto yield aggregator which prioritizes security.

    We bring our experience and thoroughness in creating enterprise-grade software to the crypto world. 
    We use proven [SecOps](https://www.servicenow.com/products/security-operations/what-is-secops.html) and [SSDLC](https://snyk.io/learn/secure-sdlc/) 
    monitoring and testing methods to develop the safest solution possible. 

    But we don't stop there. 
    We are innovating new practices that are only possible in DeFi, 
    such as conducting [95-point independent audits](https://leovs09.notion.site/Crypto-Project-Audit-Checklist-e24414dcd1c94b5f818343d46f25013d) 
    of all third-party protocols in which our solution will invest tokens.

## What is Eonian?

Eonian is a decentralized [crypto yield aggregator](/faq#what-is-yield-aggregator) that enables users to earn passive income from their crypto assets.

Eonian primary purpose is to make crypto a simpler and safer replacement for the traditional financial system. 
This is why we not only prioritize the safety of users' funds but also grant users ownership of the protocols. 
We are building a DAO that will own the protocol and direct its future development.
